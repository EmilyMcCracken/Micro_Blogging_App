# Micro_Blogging_App
This is a group assignment to create a micro-blogging app with multiple user functions

Assignment Criteria:

Building a Micro-blogging App

As an awesome exercise, you'll be building a micro-blogging app in a group of two.

Start out by sketching out your app. How will the user sign-in flow work? How will users create new posts? How will users follow other users? Who is this platform for? Illustrate and think through all of these processes. Start out on paper or using prototyping software like OmniGraffle, Photoshop, or Illustrator. Have your plans approved by your instructor before moving forward.

Just like with previous projects, please start a basic repository on GitHub with a README.md file and open issues to be assigned to each group member for all of the tasks to be done. Use branches, pull requests, and descriptive commit messages to close each issue once the work is done.

Requirements for the app are as follows.

A user should be able to:

sign up

sign in

sign out

edit their account details

delete their account

post micro-blogs (posts with less than 150 characters)

see a profile page with all of their account details and micro-blog posts to date

visit other users' profile pages

see a page with the 10 most recent posts (the "feed")

follow other users (wait for help from your instructor)

see a list of users they follow
